For explanation of the code, please refer to the published research report (pdf file).

The data was initially obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/nareshbhat/air-quality-pre-and-post-covid19-pandemic.

The initial complete data is presented in "Data(1_raw).csv" file with the following data fields:
1. City
2. Date
3. PM2.5
4. PM10
5. NO
6. NO2
7. NOx
8. NH3
9. CO
10. SO2
11. O3
12. Benzene
13. Toluene
14. Xylene
15. AQI
16. Air_quality

After removing empty cells, also removing the city and date information, we generate a new input file "Data(2_noEmpty).csv" for the machine learning application.
(In this new input data file, the header information was removed, which was point number 3-16 in the list above). 

Any discussion matters and research collaboration ideas can be sent by email to ivanksinggih@gmail.com.

Thank you.
